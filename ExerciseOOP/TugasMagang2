//Problem : Write a program with a mother class and an inherited daugther class.Both of them should have a method void
            display ()that prints a message (different for mother and daugther).In the main define a daughter and call the display() method on it.
//Solution :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class mother{
public:
	void display (){
		cout << "mother: Citra\n";
		cout << "mother: 52 Tahun\n";
	}
};
class daughter : public mother{
public:
	void display (){
		cout << "daughter: Syifa\n";
		cout << "daughter: 22 Tahun\n";
	}
};
int main (){
	daughter ap;
	ap.display();
	mother mm;
	mm.display();
	return 0;
}
